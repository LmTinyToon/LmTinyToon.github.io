Welcome to my blog, where you can find small articles on different topics (primarly related with IT).
Here I am not concerned with specific theme and major articles are used as notes, thoughts` which are made during exploration
of source codes, solving tasks and etc. If you want to improve quality of articles, edit/append materials - you are welcome, I really apreciate this.

During arising some questions you can contact with me. My contacts are shown at Contact page.
