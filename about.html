I am russian software developer with awful knowledges of english language (I  appreciate any corrections of my text). That blog 
is my attempt to keep some public comments, thoughts that can be interested for someone.

My alma mater is Southern Federal University of Rostov-on-Don. I finished the Faculty of mathematics, mechanics and computer science in 2015 year.
